- Explanation for sleep_pattern_dataset :-
In the current project, I will de-brief a dataset with Python and pandas. My initial step was to eliminate all the missing and duplicate records to have a consistent data. Subsequently, I normalized the column names writing them into lowercase characters, and thus having spaces changed into underscores, so they could be utilized in the analysis and SQL database activities far more proficiently. Numeric values (that was coded in the gender and university_year columns) helped in modeling. I also rounded continuous numeric variables e.g., time spent on sleep, time spent on studying and on screens to one decimal place as well. As the last step, the cleaned and normalized data was written out as a new CSV file to be used in further analysis.
